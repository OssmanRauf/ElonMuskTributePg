                years later he created a game called 'Blastar' and was able to sell it for $500.</li>

                merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service. Musk was
                later ousted from his role as CEO due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows. In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion
                in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million. Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.

                compressors. The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles
                Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.
            </li>
            <li class='years'> <b>2015</b> - In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of <a class="link" href='https://openai.com/' target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general
                intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well
                as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry".
            </li>

                stages of existence, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements
                could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.
